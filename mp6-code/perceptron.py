    train_set - A Numpy array of 32x32x3 images of shape [7500, 3072].
                This can be thought of as a list of 7500 vectors that are each
                3072 dimensional.  We have 3072 dimensions because there are
                each image is 32x32 and we have 3 color channels.
                So 32*32*3 = 3072
    train_labels - List of labels corresponding with images in train_set
    example: Suppose I had two images [X1,X2] where X1 and X2 are 3072 dimensional vectors
             and X1 is a picture of a dog and X2 is a picture of an airplane.
             Then train_labels := [1,0] because X1 contains a picture of an animal
             and X2 contains no animals in the picture.

    dev_set - A Numpy array of 32x32x3 images of shape [2500, 3072].
              It is the same format as train_set
